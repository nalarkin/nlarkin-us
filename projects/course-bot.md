- Developed a Python application which routinely searches for desired college courses and registers when a course becomes available
- Application is implemented through CLI commands and uses browser automation to perform searches
- Application can run completely in the background within a terminal. There is no browser window necessary
- Refactored the code to incorporate various design patterns, such as the strategy pattern and subscribe/observe pattern, among others
- Design patterns were developed using the classic book _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_
- During design I stressed the importance of communication through interface abstraction to improve the reusability, extensibility, and maintainability
