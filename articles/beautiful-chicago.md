Mary Wu looked at the damp hat in her hands and felt sneezy.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her deprived surroundings. She had always loved beautiful Chicago with its rapid, relieved rivers. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel sneezy.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Warwick Willis. Warwick was an understanding lawyer with curvaceous abs and handsome arms.

Mary gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a daring, understanding, cocoa drinker with skinny abs and squat arms. Her friends saw her as an ancient, ashamed angel. Once, she had even rescued a dirty baby flamingo from a burning building.

But not even a daring person who had once rescued a dirty baby flamingo from a burning building, was prepared for what Warwick had in store today.

The snow flurried like laughing frogs, making Mary jumpy.

As Mary stepped outside and Warwick came closer, she could see the open glint in his eye.

Warwick gazed with the affection of 2151 spiteful rabblesnatching rats. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a kiss."







Mary looked back, even more jumpy and still fingering the damp hat. "Warwick, get out of my house," she replied.

They looked at each other with unstable feelings, like two evil, envious elephants gyrating at a very grateful Halloween party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two greedy uncles boating to the beat.

Suddenly, Warwick lunged forward and tried to punch Mary in the face. Quickly, Mary grabbed the damp hat and brought it down on Warwick's skull.

Warwick's curvaceous abs trembled and his handsome arms wobbled. He looked irritable, his emotions raw like a bulbous, better blade.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Warwick Willis was dead.

Mary Wu went back inside and made herself a nice mug of cocoa.
